# TITLE: ChatPromptTemplate

## ABSTRACT: 
- ChatPromptTemplate is a class that implements the Runnable interface and is a basic building block of the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).
- It supports various calls such as invoke, ainvoke, stream, astream, batch, abatch, and astream_log.
- ChatPromptTemplate is used to create templates for generating chat prompts for language models.

## KEY POINTS:
- ChatPromptTemplate implements the Runnable interface in the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).
- It supports various calls such as invoke, ainvoke, stream, astream, batch, abatch, and astream_log.
- ChatPromptTemplate is used to create templates for generating chat prompts for language models.

## CONTEXT: 
- ChatPromptTemplate is a class that implements the Runnable interface in the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).
- It is a basic building block of the LCEL and supports various calls such as invoke, ainvoke, stream, astream, batch, abatch, and astream_log.
- ChatPromptTemplate is used to create templates for generating chat prompts for language models.
- It accepts a dictionary as input and returns a ChatPromptValue.
- The ChatPromptValue can be converted to a string or a list of chat messages.
- The ChatPromptTemplate is flexible and allows for different representations of chat messages, such as using tuples or instances of MessagePromptTemplate or BaseMessage.
- The ChatPromptTemplate provides a lot of flexibility in constructing chat prompts for language models.
